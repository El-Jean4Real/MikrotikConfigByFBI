By default, Mikrotik will not allow a connection from WinBox over the WAN.  Here is how you change that.

From WinBox:

    1 - Click on IP, then Firewall, then Filter Rules.
    2 - Click the + to add a new rule.
    3 - Change Chain to input.
    4 - Change Protocol to tcp.
    5 - Change Dst. Port to 8291.
    6 - Click on the Action tab and make sure Action is set to accept.
    7 - Click Comment and name it something like “Winbox By WAN”, Click OK.
    
    #MOST IMPORTANT RULE
    
    Your new Filter Rule will be at the bottom of the list. Drag it UP above the last “drop” rule from the default configuration.
    Because filter Rules are matched in order. They start at the top and work through each one.  If your new rule is AFTER the “drop” rule, it will not work.
